# Pico Habit Calendar

A Habit Calendar implemented on the [Pico Display Pack 2.8"](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pico-display-pack-2-8?variant=42047194005587)

## Development Environment

I am using Visual Studio Code.

Install the MicroPico (Pico-W-Go) extension in order to connect to the Raspberry Pi Pico W, that is used on the Cosmic Unicorn.

## Wifi Setup

Create 'wifi_config.py' with the following content:

```
WIFI_SSID = 'ssid'
WIFI_PASSWORD = 'pwd'
```
Obviously change the ssid and pwd to those applicable to your wifi network.
